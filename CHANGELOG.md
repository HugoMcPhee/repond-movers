TODO

- update mover2d to check distance and shouldKeepMoving speed, so it dosen't trigger from average speed at the start
- use position pool objects where copyPoint is used, (like for prevStepState & currentStepState)

v1.2.0

- Added support for multiple time sources (time keys)
  - `initMovers` now accepts an object with named time keys: `initMovers({ default: [...], game: [...], ui: [...] })`
  - `addMoverEffects` accepts optional `timeKey` parameter to assign movers to specific time sources
  - Enables independent time control for different animation layers (e.g., pause game while UI continues)
  - Fully backward compatible with existing array-style `initMovers([...])` syntax
- Updated to repond ^1.2.0

- removed interpolate from mover to fix on iPad

v0.4.1

- updated mover2d and mover3d to use point inPlace mutable functions to avoid creating lots of objects in a physics step,
  which could cause garbage collection stuttering

- removoed some eslint warnings

v0.3.1
